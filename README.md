# Frontend Practice

This repo is a collection of projects built to practice frontend skills.

In general, my intention is not to be pixel-perfect with the existing designs.
Rather, I'm focusing on the 80% that takes 20% of the effort (mostly because I don't have the time to do the 20% that takes 80% of the effort).

This mostly means focusing on things like layout (including general responsiveness), overall styling, and some animation.

Things I'm not focusing on as much are exact padding/margin values, exact responsive breakpoints, icons/images (I'll generally just use placeholders), etc.
